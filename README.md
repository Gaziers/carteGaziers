# carteGaziers
A highly ambitious project that allows our group of friends to always know where any of us is located in the world. That might be really useful if ever one of us falls in a sudden coma and wakes up with a total amnesia but miraculously this project is displayed on his hospital room's terminal so he remembers every last one of us.
